# non vibe - coded my own ai (well took a bit help for folder structure cuz i am still learning :)))
  right now only works on terminal, you ask a question and it gives you the answer to it in the most short way possible, it is very concise and sharp, unlike other ai's which just gives too much unwanted explanation.

## what? 
   so it is more of a fact-checker, the thing is right now it might be very vulnerable to prompt injections, i need to fix that up. 
   as of 16th august: it only works on terminal
