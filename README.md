# my own ai (well took a bit help for folder structure cuz i am still learning..

basically learnt on api calling on how you can efficietly use it my roa.py file is perfect for that. Used ai for setting up flask and frontend
i have hosted backend in google cloud, 
just open the index.html, wont work if you open up the above link. Used ai for setting up dockerfile cuz i knew too less about it.
only 50 requests gemini bro please increase i want this to be used by my friends more:((((

## what?

so it is more of a fact-checker, the thing is : right now it might be very vulnerable to prompt injections, i need to fix that up.
as of 16th august: now should work if you open up the index and when you download the apk... might be few bugs need to fix that up (ui also)

## how?

1.  clone this repo
2.  python -m venv .venv
3.  source .venv/bin/activate (remove "source" if you arent on mac)

### requirements:

i would suggest you to install these packages :
flask
flask-cors
requests
langchain-google-genai
pydantic
langgraph

## why?

well i always wanted to do some kinda of app. This is something that i was able to do while just learning how to do an ai agent: the guide of which was there in the latest open-source magazine. So if you dont mind, you can always test out the app roa-ai.apk
