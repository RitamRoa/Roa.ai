## what?

so it is more of a fact-checker.

## how?

1.  clone this repo
2.  python -m venv .venv
3.  source .venv/bin/activate (remove "source" if you arent on mac)

### requirements:

i would suggest you to install these packages :
flask
flask-cors
requests
langchain-google-genai
pydantic
langgraph

## why?

well i always wanted to do some kinda of app. This is something that i was able to do while just learning how to do an ai agent: the guide of which was there in the latest open-source magazine. So if you dont mind, you can always test out the app roa-ai.apk, for this dm me in my socials (handles at profile).
